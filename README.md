# Spring Pet clinic

*This project is at work now and doesn't complete.*

[Run the application](https://spring5-pet-clinic.herokuapp.com/)

The Spring Pet clinic is a sample application designed to show how the Spring stack can be used to build simple, but powerful database-oriented applications. Part of the course [Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/)

## What I did on this project

- Implemented **POJO data model** for entities in the project
- Created **multi-module Maven project** to separate levels of data and web

- To demonstrate different options of service implementations I created **Map-based services** and **JPA-services**
- Set up **automatic deploys to Heroku** from GitHub repo
