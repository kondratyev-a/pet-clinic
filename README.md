# Spring Pet clinic

*This project is at work now and doesn't complete.*

The Spring Pet clinic is a sample application designed to show how the Spring stack can be used to build simple, but powerful database-oriented applications. Part of the course [Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/)

## What I did on this project

- Created **multi-module Maven project** to separate levels of data and web
- Added **Maven release plugin** to prepare and build releases and publish them on Github
- Created **service-level interfaces** to access the data
- To demonstrate different options of service implementations I created **Map-based services**
